# Feedback on MetaMask Delegation Toolkit Documentation

**Link to Docs:** [https://docs.gator.metamask.io/get-started/install-delegation-toolkit](https://docs.gator.metamask.io/get-started/install-delegation-toolkit)

## 🌟 Great Start!

The documentation is a solid first step towards introducing developers to the MetaMask Delegation Toolkit (DTK). However, I have some constructive feedback that may help improve usability, clarity, and accessibility for a wider range of users.

---

## ⚙️ Installation Instructions: Clarify the Context

The docs provide installation options using:

```bash
npm install @metamask/delegation-toolkit
```
...with options for npm, Yarn, or pnpm. However, it's unclear:

- Is this meant to be a global installation or a local project dependency?
- What's the intended use case of the SDK — CLI tool, frontend library, or integration layer?

📝 **Suggestion**: Clarify whether the SDK should be installed globally or as a dependency in a specific type of project (frontend dApp, Node.js backend, etc.). Include examples of when and why to choose each option.

## 🔧 Smart Contract Setup: Alternative to Foundry

The current documentation assumes the user will use Foundry (forge) to install and interact with contracts. However:

- Not all systems support or are configured for Foundry.
- Users from other ecosystems (e.g., Hardhat, Truffle, or even Remix) may struggle to proceed.

📝 **Suggestion**: Provide alternative ways to add the Delegation Toolkit contracts:

- Option 1: Foundry (as currently shown)
- Option 2: Hardhat-compatible method
- Option 3: Direct ABI and contract address usage

This makes it accessible to users without needing to install Foundry.

## 🚀 Quick Start: Needs a Practical Example

The "Quick Start" section jumps into high-level usage without grounding the reader:

- There's no boilerplate or minimal working example to build upon.
- There's no visual walkthrough or code snippet demonstrating the Delegation Toolkit in action.

📝 **Suggestion**: Include a minimal "hello world" style example that:

- Imports and initializes the Delegation Toolkit
- Sets up permissions and signing flow
- Shows how it integrates with MetaMask

Even a single end-to-end flow (e.g., delegate a transaction) would significantly improve onboarding.

## 📦 Boilerplate / Starter Kit

You refer to this as an SDK, which implies some degree of abstraction and developer-friendliness. However:

- There's no example project, repo, or sandboxed playground.
- Users new to this concept or toolkit are left guessing how to start.

📝 **Suggestion**: Provide a GitHub repo with a sample integration (e.g., React + Ethers + DTK) or a StackBlitz/CodeSandbox environment to interact with it live.

## 📘 Better Explanation of the Toolkit

There's limited guidance on what the Delegation Toolkit actually does, why someone would use it, and what key problems it solves.

📝 **Suggestion**: Start with a 2–3 sentence explanation of the toolkit's purpose, followed by:

- A diagram or simple infographic
- Clear use cases (e.g., "Use this when you want a delegated signer to interact on behalf of another address...")
- Common developer flows

## ✅ Final Summary

- Clarify whether the SDK is global or local
- Provide alternatives to Foundry for contract management
- Make the Quick Start more actionable with a working example
- Offer a starter template or sample repo
- Clearly explain what the Delegation Toolkit is, who it's for, and when to use it

Thanks for the amazing work so far — with a few tweaks, the documentation can become much more inclusive and developer-friendly!
